# kitty-conf

## Configuration for the kitty terminal emulator

Directions are very simple:

1. Symlink `kitty.conf` into `~/.config/kitty/`.
2. Install [kitty-themes](https://github.com/dexpota/kitty-themes) as
   described in the `README.md`. Symlink one of the themes to `theme.conf`.
(If you want to be like me, choose `Dark_Pastel.conf`.)
